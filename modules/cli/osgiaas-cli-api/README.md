# OSGiaaS CLI API Module

API bundle for all OSGiaaS CLI implementation bundles.

Besides the main functionality interfaces (`StreamingCommand` and `CommandCompleter`),
this bundle also contains several helper classes and interfaces that make it easier to implement commands
and command completers.

General documentation at [docs/cli/osgiaas-cli.md](../../../docs/cli/osgiaas-cli.md).
