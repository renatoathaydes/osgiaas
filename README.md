# OSGiaaS

> OSGi as a Service

The **OSGiaaS** Project aims to provide JVM modules and a CLI to make the development
of truly modular, dynamic applications easier.

Though all modules are OSGi bundles, many modules can also be used without OSGi (in standard Java applications).

See the [Documentation](docs/index.md) in the docs directory.
